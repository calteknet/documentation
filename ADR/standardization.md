# ADR 1: Comprehensive Reform of Project Structure and Processes

## Context and Problem Statement

This project has been ongoing for decades, evolving into a complex system with very little standardization, no clear roadmap, limited and hard-to-find documentation, minimal accountability, and significant overall complexity. These issues have hindered progress, made maintenance increasingly difficult, and reduced the effectiveness of new team members joining the project.

## Objective

To establish a coherent, standardized framework for the project, incorporating a clear, accessible documentation system, a defined roadmap, enhanced accountability, and streamlined processes to tackle the existing complexity and improve overall efficiency and maintainability.

## Considered Options

### Standardization
- Adopt industry best practices and frameworks
- Define internal standards specific to the project needs

### Roadmap Development
- Develop a short-term action plan with immediate goals
- Establish a long-term vision with flexible, milestone-based planning

### Documentation Improvement
- Centralize all documentation with an easy-to-navigate repository
- Standardize documentation practices and require documentation for all future developments

### Enhancing Accountability
- Restructure teams with clear roles and responsibilities
- Introduce performance metrics and regular review processes

### Complexity Reduction
- Conduct a thorough review to identify and eliminate redundant or obsolete components
- Modularize the system to isolate and simplify complex areas

## Decision Outcome

After thorough consideration, the following options were chosen for each area:

- **Standardization**: TBD
- **Roadmap Development**: TBD
- **Documentation Improvement**: TBD
- **Enhancing Accountability**: TBD
- **Complexity Reduction**: TBD

These decisions were made based on their potential to provide the most immediate and impactful benefits to the project, considering the current state of disarray and the need for significant reform.

### Consequences

- **Pro**: These changes are expected to significantly improve project clarity, efficiency, and maintainability, making it easier for existing and new team members to contribute effectively.
Good: Standardization and a clear roadmap will provide a much-needed direction, facilitating better planning and resource allocation.
- **Con**: The initial phases of implementing these changes will require significant effort and could disrupt current workflows, potentially causing delays in the short term.
- **Con**: Resistance to change may be encountered from team members accustomed to the current way of working, necessitating careful change management strategies.

## Implementation Strategy

A phased implementation approach will be adopted, starting with the development of internal standards and the centralization of documentation. Short-term roadmap goals will be identified and initiated in parallel. Team restructuring and the introduction of performance metrics will follow, with complexity reduction efforts commencing once a stable foundation has been established. Each phase will include pilot tests, feedback periods, and adjustments based on lessons learned.

## Monitoring and Evaluation

Success metrics will include improved project documentation accessibility, completion of roadmap milestones, positive feedback from team members on clarity of roles and responsibilities, and measurable reductions in system complexity. Regular reviews will be conducted at the end of each implementation phase, with comprehensive evaluations planned annually.
